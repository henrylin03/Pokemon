## Description
Having grown up in the '90s, Pokemon was an intimate part of my life; both as a videogame, and an anime. Like many, Pokemon occupies a very dear place in my heart, and is closely tied to feelings of nostalgia.

Motivated by this, in this Project, I analyse Pokemon data across the 6 Generations. I answer questions such as:

* What are the strongest Pokemons in each Generation?
* Have Pokemons become more overpowered with each Generation?
* Is there a relationship between Pokemons' types and their strength?

The data is originally sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon).

## How to View
All code is within the `pokemon_eda.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. 

The input `.csv` is within the `/input` subfolder.
